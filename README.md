This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## SWELL APP

This is fully functional CRUD application connected to a MONGODB database. The intent of this application is to be able to add, remove, and edit my and my friends favorite surf spots! feel free to add your own!

To get started use the navigation bar at the top of the page to Navigate to the 'Spots' page. There you will be able to see all of the surf spots within the database. Feel free then to edit, or delete spots as you see fit! 

If you want to add your own surf spot use the navigation bar at the top again to go to the ADD spots page.

I wrote this application myself with help from documentation from Next.js, and Mongodb Atlas.
